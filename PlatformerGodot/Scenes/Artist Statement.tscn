students at this school in order to pass this assignment. I chose to make this game the way it is because I want the laptop to be alive. Have you ever seen those Pixar movies
where the toy or the car is acting like a real person? That is what I wanted to do here. When you plug a laptop into its charger, does it sleep? Does it have nightmares? I am
answering this question through my game. I want you to go through the game as if you are trying to survive not being destroyed by a hammer. All you have to do is to make it
out of this nightmare alive. 

Are you able to do this?"
